## ExploratoryDataAnalysis

##### Contains .ipynb files of EDA on WHR(World happiness Report) datasets

This file contains all the code along with the Inference for the Exploratory Data Analysis on the World happiness Report. 
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – 
economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.
I have attempted to understand the Key motivations for WHR and to identify any patterns if they exist. 
The Data set originally contains no missing values.
